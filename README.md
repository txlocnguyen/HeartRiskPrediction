The project focuses on analyzing the relationship between heart disease and various risk factors, such as age, sex, body mass index (BMI), and smoking status. The data used in the project was obtained from a heart disease dataset, which was cleaned and then loaded into a Pandas data frame for further analysis. The project uses the Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries to visualize the results and make inferences about the relationships between heart disease and the risk factors.

The project calculates the percentage of individuals with heart disease for different age groups and plots a line graph to visualize the relationship between heart disease and age. The graph shows that the risk of heart disease increases with age. The project also calculates the percentage of individuals with heart disease for males and females and plots a bar graph to visualize the difference in risk between the two genders. The graph shows that males have a higher risk of heart disease compared to females.

In addition, the project calculates the percentage of individuals with heart disease for different BMI categories and different smoking statuses. A logistic regression model was then used to predict the likelihood of an individual having heart disease based on the variables of BMI and smoking status. The results of the logistic regression model showed that both BMI and smoking status are significant predictors of heart disease.

The application also uses machine learning algorithms to analyze the user's information and predict the likelihood of heart disease. The user can input their own information and receive an immediate risk assessment.
